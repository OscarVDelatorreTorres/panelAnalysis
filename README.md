# panelAnalysis V. 1.0

The panelAnalysis function is a starting one developed by [Dr. Oscar V. De la Torre Torres](https://oscardelatorretorres.com) to support the basic panel analysis for Econometrics-related students and researchers. If a given academic wants to perform $k$ regression and must decide which panel regression model is the best-fitting (from pooled regression, fixed-effects, or random-effects), she or he must estimate the three models and use the F and Hausman tests.

$y_{i,t}=\alpha+beta\cdot x_{i,t}+\varepsilon_{i,t}$
