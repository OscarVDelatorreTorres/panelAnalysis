# panelAnalysis V. 1.0

The panelAnalysis function is a starting one developed by [Dr. Oscar V. De la Torre Torres](https://oscardelatorretorres.com) to support the basic panel analysis for Econometrics-related students and researchers. If a given academic wants to perform an $n$ number of regressions, he or she must decide which panel regression model is the best-fitting (from pooled regression, fixed-effects, or random-effects). The appropriate process to follow is to estimate the three models and use the F and Hausman tests. This leads to performing the estimation of the three models and the estimation of these two tests.

This task can be don with the [plm package](https://github.com/ycroissant/plm/) of [Croissant and Millo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/plm/vignettes/A_plmPackage.html).
